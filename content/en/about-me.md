# Hi!
    
I'm Piotr, nice to meet You.

![Dev of notes](me.jpg "Dev of notes")
                                
I'm a software developer. My day-to-day job is about "delivering" solutions or designing them, for someone else to deliver. 
                                                                                     
Years of work with projects, from small hello-sites, to huge e-commerce portals, tought me that six hours of debugging might save me five minutes of reading the documentation.

# Open source

I am timidly starting to take my steps in the world of open source.

## ðŸ“¦ Dinjectease

Tiny DI container based on configuration files. This solution was inspired by [Pimple](https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple).
                                                                                                                           
I wanted to be able to control dependencies in a way I know from the **Symfony** or other PHP frameworks.
Most of the existing solutions cluttered the service code to a greater or lesser extent. **Dinjectease**, on the other hand, allows you to configure all dependencies in a separate config file.

# I'm online

In addition to the [DevNotes](https://devnotes.blog) blog, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rzeczkowskip), where from time to time I will say something about code or basketball (sometimes in Polish, sometimes in English tho).
If you want to contact me outside of Twitter, feel free to get in touch through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rzeczkowskip/).
Of course I did not forget to mention my [GitHub](https://github.com/rzeczkowskip), where I keep more or less useful code.
